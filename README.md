# Twins-SprayCharts

This is a script that displays batted-ball location data for the 2018 and 2019 Minnesota Twins, as well as for the 2018 and 2019 season of Max Kepler. It begins with a visual representation of pythagorean winning percentage in the MLB. Then, you can select whether you want to view singles, doubles, triples, or home runs for each season of the Minnesota Twins, as well as each season of Max Kepler. The script will also return some descriptive statistics (pull %, opposite field %) for the type of hit you select. After viewing each of the spray charts, the script also displays some more batted-ball data for both the Twins and Max Kepler. 

The purpose of this project was to suggest that offensive production could increase as hitters increase their pull percentage.
